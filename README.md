## ⚡️ **CRUCIAL: Folder/Mapping Alignment**

**To ensure accurate metadata and art, your league folder names and TheSportsDB league mappings MUST match (case-insensitive)!**

> **You MUST configure your league mappings _before_ scanning your library with Jellyfin.**  
> If you add new leagues or rename league folders, update the mapping and rescan.

- The **immediate parent folder** of your event files should exactly match a mapping entry (e.g., `EPL`, `ICC T20 WC`, `NFL`, etc.).
- If the folder name does not match a league mapping, the plugin will not be able to resolve the correct league, causing lookups to fail and no metadata/posters to appear.
- Any league or competition available on TheSportsDB can be mapped; simply match your folder name and set the correct League ID.

#### **Example Table**

| Folder Name        | League ID | Example Path                                   |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| EPL                | 4328      | `/media/Sports/EPL/2025-2026/2026-02-08 Liverpool vs Manchester City.mkv`     |
| ICC T20 WC         | 5103      | `/media/Sports/ICC T20 WC/2026/ICC Mens T20 World Cup 2026-02-15 India Cricket vs Pakistan Cricket.mkv` |
| NFL                | 4391      | `/media/Sports/NFL/2025/2026-01-15 Buffalo Bills vs Baltimore Ravens.mkv`   |

> **Note:** If you rename a folder (e.g., `ICC T20 WC` → `ICC T20 Mens WC`), you must create a matching mapping in the plugin for the new folder name and rescan the library.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Setting up your API Key

1. Get a free API key from [TheSportsDB.com](https://www.thesportsdb.com/)
2. Go to **Dashboard > Plugins > TheSportsDB**
3. Enter your **API Key**
4. Click **Save**

> **Note:** Jellyfin will restart automatically after saving configuration changes.

### League Mappings

The plugin includes built-in support for popular leagues (see [Known Leagues](#-known-leagues-built-in) below). **For custom or abbreviated folder names, you must create manual mappings before scanning your library:**

1. Go to **Dashboard > Plugins > TheSportsDB**
2. Scroll to **League Mappings**
3. Click **Add Mapping**
4. Enter your **Folder Name** — just the parent folder name, NOT the full path (e.g., `EPL`, `Süper Lig`)
5. Enter the **TheSportsDB League ID** (you can find these on TheSportsDB.com league pages)
6. Click **Save**

> **Reminder**: Mapping changes require a **full library rescan** for new/changed folders.

## 📝 Recommended File Naming Guide

**File and directory naming matters most for accurate matching!** Clean, consistent filenames and correct folder mapping produce the best results.

### Best Formats (by Match Rate)

| Format                   | Example                                                     | Match Rate |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `YYYY-MM-DD Team1 vs Team2` | `2026-02-08 Liverpool vs Manchester City.mkv`               | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐      |
| `YYYY-MM-DD-ABBR-ABBR`      | `2026-02-05-NJD-NYI.mkv`                                    | ⭐⭐         |
| `Team1 vs Team2`            | `Liverpool vs Manchester City.mkv`                          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       |
| `Full Event Name`           | `UFC 315 Jones vs Aspinall.mkv`                             | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       |
| `YYYY Team1 vs Team2 DD MM` | `2026 Liverpool vs Manchester City 08 02.mkv`               | ⭐⭐⭐        |
| `League YYYY Team1 vs Team2 ...` | `EPL 2026 Liverpool vs Manchester City 08 02 720p.mkv` | ⭐⭐         |

### Key Naming Rules

- **✅ Always use ISO dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`)** if possible
- **✅ Use full team names** where possible (less ambiguous)
- **✅ Use `vs` as the separator** between team names
- **✅ Make sure the folder name is mapped** in plugin settings ("League Mappings")
- **✅ Avoid scene tags/noise in filenames** when possible (e.g., `720p`, `Fubo`, `x264`—the plugin will attempt to strip these, but cleaner is better)
- **✅ Use season/year subfolders for organization**
- **✅ 3-letter team abbreviations are best for NHL**
- **✅ Soccer/football: Use full club names**

### Recommended Folder Structure (Universal Format)

Use POSIX-style forward slashes for cross-platform compatibility.

```plaintext
/media/Sports/
├── EPL/
│   └── 2025-2026/
│       ├── 2026-02-08 Liverpool vs Manchester City.mkv

## 🔧 How the Plugin Works

The plugin uses a sophisticated matching pipeline to find the correct metadata for your sports files:

1. **Derive Series/League Name**: Extracts the league name from your folder structure (parent folder is used for mapping).
2. **Resolve League ID**: Searches for the league ID in this order:
   - User-configured League Mappings (requires mapping before scanning the library!)
   - Built-in internal league map (NHL, EPL, NFL, NBA, MLB, UFC)
   - Local `sports_resolver.db` database
   - TheSportsDB API search (last resort)
3. **Clean the Filename**: Removes dates, league prefixes, and scene tags from the filename
4. **Expand Team Abbreviations**: Converts common abbreviations to full team names (e.g., MTL → Montreal Canadiens)
5. **Search TheSportsDB API**: Searches for matching events using the cleaned team names, mapped league ID/slug, and date if available
6. **Date-Based Fallback**: If no match found, falls back to date-based lookup with ±1 day tolerance (helps with timezone slippage)

## 🏆 Known Leagues (Built-in)

The following leagues have built-in support and don't require manual mapping:

| League | League ID | Sport           |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| NHL    | 4380      | Ice Hockey 🏒    |
| EPL    | 4328      | Soccer ⚽        |

**Note:** Any league on TheSportsDB can be used via League Mappings. The above are built-in for convenience.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"No metadata found" or Empty Results**
- Check your filename format — use ISO date and clean team names
- Verify the event exists on TheSportsDB.com
- Check your API key is correctly configured
- Make sure your **league folder is mapped in plugin settings before library scan**
- Try using full team names instead of abbreviations

**"Season Unknown"**
- Ensure your season folder contains the year (e.g., `2025-2026`)
- Check that the parent folder matches a known league or has a mapping configured

**"Logs stop after saving configuration"**
- Normal: Jellyfin always restarts after plugin config is saved
- Wait a minute for the server to reload, then check your library again

**"Wrong match found" or Incorrect Metadata**
- Use more specific filenames with ISO dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Include full team names
- Verify your names match TheSportsDB.com events

**Plugin doesn't recognize my league folder (e.g., "Bundesliga", "La Liga")**
- Add a League Mapping in the plugin configuration before your first scan
- Find the League ID on TheSportsDB.com (`https://www.thesportsdb.com/league/4331` → ID is `4331`)
